Notes:
- Tasks without clear action mappings (e.g., non-work related tasks like breaks or social media) are indicated as [task dropped].
- Some action parameter values that werenâ€™t explicitly listed in the context are generated as placeholders that would be filled appropriately during real implementations (e.g., email appPassword, Telegram token, and recipients lists).
- Certain tasks such as diagnosing issues in pipelines or monitoring server configurations involve applications or browser use, mapped to relevant URLs like JIRA or Azure Documentation.
